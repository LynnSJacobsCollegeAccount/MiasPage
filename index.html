				I am a second-year graduate student at the Georgia Institute of
				Technology in Computational Science and Engineering, which is simply the
				 best part of Computer Science. I was born in Germany and completed an
				 undergraduate program in Aerospace Engineering and obtained my Master’s
				  in Mechanical Engineering at the Technical University in Munich. So,
					if I want to brag, I can tell people that I am an aerospace engineer,
					a mechanical engineer, and a computer scientist. If I am being honest
					though, I am a computer scientist through and through, because
					computer science and especially Machine Learning is.

        <strong>Sports:</strong> I love sports: my favorite sport is running,
				but I also like surfing, scuba diving. I enjoy every sport connected to
				mountains: hiking, skiing, bouldering - you name it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Passions:</strong> The greatest love of my life are desserts,
				and in particular pastries. I love baking cakes, cupcakes, cookies,
				brownies, anything that is sweet and buttery and preferably has
				chocolate in it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dislikes:</strong> I am okay with spiders, but there is nothing
				 that freaks me out like roaches and yes, that can lead to problems when
				  living in Atlanta. I also hate scorpions, but at least I don’t
					encounter them as much here.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> So far, I've been to 4 different continents
				and 53 countries! I can't wait to see the others.

      <h2>Safety in Atlanta</h2>
      <p>
        Last semester I built a data science tool that helps to identify
				locations in Atlanta that are most likely to be a crimes scene in the
				next future. This tool uses data about population about the location,
				business, close by as well as data about past crimes in Atlanta and
				their locations and on recent crimes in Atlanta to determine which areas
				 need the most police presence to prevent crimes and which areas should
				 be avoided by pedestrians.
